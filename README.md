## 🚀 About the Project

This is a command-line based Rubik’s Cube solver built in C++. It reads the cube’s state and computes the optimal or near-optimal solution using advanced search algorithms and precomputed pattern databases.

The project is structured into modular components like Model, Solver, and Databases to make it clean and extensible.
